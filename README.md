# MemoryGame
Author: Yasser Ghamlouch

This project is a memory game written in Java using Swing and various data structures.
 
 The game goes as following:
 
 On a 4 x 6 board, a player can find twelve pairs of cards that have been laid face down. Each card displays an image. The
player chooses two cards at a time that he would like to turn face up. He chooses these cards by clicking on them. If the images
on the two cards match, they will be automatically removed from the board, otherwise they will be automatically turned face
down. The player will continue to sequentially choose two cards until all cards will be matched. The strategy of the game is to
try and remember where on the board the mismatched cards are placed and what do those cards display such that the player can
subsequently improve his matching choices. The game ends when all cards have been matched (and removed from the board).
